# Rural Poverty in Developing Countries
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
Rural poverty in developing countries remains a pressing global issue. It signifies a state of economic deprivation and limited access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, and healthcare among rural populations. This issue is of significant contemporary importance for several reasons:

Human Welfare: Rural poverty directly affects the well-being of millions of individuals and communities, leading to malnutrition, limited educational opportunities, and inadequate healthcare.
Economic Development: Rural areas often serve as the backbone of many developing countries' economies through agriculture. Addressing rural poverty is crucial for boosting agricultural productivity and overall economic growth.
Social Disparities: Rural-urban disparities in income and resources exacerbate social inequalities, potentially leading to social unrest and political instability.
Global Goals: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to eradicate poverty. Tackling rural poverty is central to achieving these global targets.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
