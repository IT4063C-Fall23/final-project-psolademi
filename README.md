# Rural Poverty in Developing Countries
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
Rural poverty in developing countries remains a pressing global issue. It signifies a state of economic deprivation and limited access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, and healthcare among rural populations. This issue is of significant contemporary importance for several reasons:

Human Welfare: Rural poverty directly affects the well-being of millions of individuals and communities, leading to malnutrition, limited educational opportunities, and inadequate healthcare.
Economic Development: Rural areas often serve as the backbone of many developing countries' economies through agriculture. Addressing rural poverty is crucial for boosting agricultural productivity and overall economic growth.
Social Disparities: Rural-urban disparities in income and resources exacerbate social inequalities, potentially leading to social unrest and political instability.
Global Goals: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to eradicate poverty. Tackling rural poverty is central to achieving these global targets.

### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well? 
I believe the project ideation and execution went well
#### What did not go well?
It was a bit difficult getting the data thatn accurately describes what I was looking for from the web
#### What did you learn? 
I learnt a lot about the economic indications, the poverty levels and rate, I had to do some more research in terms of the comparison of developing companies with developed countries. 
#### What would you do differently next time?
Learn more


#### Here are my thoughts and some answers to the questions

#### Primary Causes of Rural Poverty in Developing Countries:
Limited Access to Resources: Lack of access to land, water, and basic infrastructure.
Agricultural Dependency: Reliance on subsistence farming, vulnerability to market fluctuations, and climate change.
Limited Education and Skills: Insufficient access to quality education and vocational training.
Healthcare Access: Inadequate healthcare facilities, leading to poor health and high healthcare costs.
Economic Disparities: Unequal distribution of resources and wealth.
Variations in Rural Poverty:
Geographic Differences: Disparities exist due to geographical locations and natural resources.
Country-Specific Factors: Economic policies, political stability, and governance influence poverty levels.
Cultural and Social Dynamics: Influence of traditions, gender disparities, and social norms.
Challenges Faced by Rural Populations:
Infrastructure: Lack of roads, electricity, and connectivity hinder development.
Education: Limited access to schools, qualified teachers, and resources.
Healthcare: Scarce medical facilities and health professionals.
Agricultural Practices: Vulnerability to environmental changes, lack of modern techniques.


Effective Interventions and Policies:
Investment in Infrastructure: Building roads, electricity, and improving connectivity.
Education Initiatives: Promoting literacy, vocational training, and skill development.
Healthcare Access: Establishing healthcare facilities and awareness programs.
Agricultural Reforms: Implementing sustainable farming practices and providing resources.
Microfinance and Social Programs: Empowering rural communities through financial inclusion and support.


Consequences of  Poverty:
Short-Term Impact: Malnutrition, diseases, limited opportunities, and poor living conditions.
Long-Term Effects: Cycle of poverty, reduced economic productivity, social marginalization.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.
