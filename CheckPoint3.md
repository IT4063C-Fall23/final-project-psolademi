# Rural Poverty in Developing Countries
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
Poverty in developing countries remains a pressing global issue. It signifies a state of economic deprivation and limited access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, and healthcare among rural populations. This issue is of significant contemporary importance for several reasons:



1. Machine Learning Plan
Type of Machine Learning Model:
The project aims to harness supervised machine learning, particularly regression models, to predict rural poverty rates based on socioeconomic indicators. Given the labeled nature of the dataset, regression models are suitable for this predictive task.

Anticipated Challenges:
Data Scarcity: I've encountered a potential challenge due to limited comprehensive data available for all countries. This might restrict the model's accuracy and its ability to generalize well but I will be working on them.
Feature Selection: With a plethora of available indicators, I'm working on selecting the most influential ones without causing multicollinearity issues.
Model Complexity: Striking a balance between model complexity for accuracy and maintaining interpretability for stakeholders is a significant concern.
Addressing Challenges:
Data Augmentation: I'm exploring different avenues to acquire additional datasets or augment the existing one. This could enrich the diversity of features and fortify the model's robustness.
Advanced Feature Selection: I'm considering implementing techniques such as PCA or feature importance analysis to precisely pinpoint critical indicators and engineer new features where needed.
Model Selection and Simplification: I'm opting for simpler models and fine-tuning hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model remains interpretable.
2. Machine Learning Implementation Process
Implementation Strategy:
Comprehensive EDA: I'm continuing with an in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover missing values, outliers, and categorical variables for preprocessing.
Dataset Segmentation: I've segregated the dataset into training and test sets, ensuring an equitable distribution of data across both sets.
Data Preparation and Pipelining: I'm employing scikit-learn pipelines to systematically handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize or scale data.
Categorical Data Handling: I'm utilizing encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical variables.
Model Evaluation and Selection: I'm experimenting with a range of regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. I'm evaluating their performance using cross-validation and essential metrics.
Performance Assessment: I'm using robust evaluation metrics like RMSE or MAE to compare models and finalize the most suitable one.
