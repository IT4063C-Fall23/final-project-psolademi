# Rural Poverty in Developing Countries
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
Poverty in developing countries remains a pressing global issue. It signifies a state of economic deprivation and limited access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, and healthcare among rural populations. This issue is of significant contemporary importance for several reasons:

Insights Extracted:
Notably, there's a clear correlation between rural poverty rates and both Gross National Income (GNI) and Human Development Index (HDI). This correlation underscores the intricate relationship between economic factors and the overall development index concerning poverty.

Variable Distributions:
Histograms were employed effectively to visualize income distributions across various developing countries. These distributions vividly portrayed the disparities in income levels, shedding light on the socioeconomic conditions prevailing across nations.

Correlation Analysis:
The use of scatter plots effectively explored the intricate relationship between education levels and rural poverty rates. These visualizations showcased a discernible pattern, indicating that nations with higher education access tend to exhibit lower rural poverty rates.

Identified Issues and Treatment Plan:
Noticed missing values within the healthcare access data. As a solution, a plan has been devised to fill these gaps by leveraging country-specific averages, ensuring a more complete dataset for analysis.

Data Visualization
Selection of Visualizations:
Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were chosen due to their versatility in generating a wide array of visualizations to convey complex information effectively.

Four Key Visualizations:
Histogram on Income Distribution: Offers a comprehensive view of income disparities among developing nations, serving as a visual testament to varying economic statuses.

Scatter Plot on Education vs. Rural Poverty: Demonstrates the intricate relationship between education levels and rural poverty, providing a clear visual understanding of their correlation.

Bar Chart on Rural Poverty Trends Over Time: Visualizes the trajectory of rural poverty rates over time, aiding in identifying temporal patterns and trends.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
Handling Data Issues:
Missing Values: A strategic plan has been devised to address missing healthcare access data by imputing averages specific to respective countries, ensuring a more complete dataset.

Duplicate Entries: Rigorous checks were performed to detect and eliminate any duplicated records within the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

Outlier Treatment: Identified outliers within income distributions, contemplating their relevance to the analysis to determine whether to retain or remove them.

Data Type Transformation: No significant alterations in data types were deemed necessary, maintaining the compatibility of data for analysis purposes.
