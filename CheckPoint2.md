# Rural Poverty in Developing Countries
<!-- Edit the title above with your project title -->

## Project Overview
Poverty in developing countries remains a pressing global issue. It signifies a state of economic deprivation and limited access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, and healthcare among rural populations. This issue is of significant contemporary importance for several reasons:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Sources: No additional datasets found; current data seems sufficient for analysis.
Insights Extracted: Found a correlation between rural poverty rates with GNI and HDI
Variable Distributions: Showed income distribution across countries using histograms.
Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between poverty and education using scatter plots.
Identified Issues: Noticed missing values in healthcare access data.
Treatment Plan: Will fill missing healthcare data using averages for respective countries.

2. Data Visualization
Selection of Visualizations: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for diverse visualizations.
Four Visualizations:
Histogram depicting income distribution across developing countries.
Scatter plot highlighting the relationship between education and rural poverty.
Bar chart showing healthcare access levels by country.
Line chart illustrating the trend in rural poverty rates over time.

3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Handling Missing Values: Addressed missing population data by imputing with country-specific averages.
Dealing with Duplicates: Checked for and removed any duplicate entries in the dataset.
Outlier and Anomaly Treatment: Identified outliers in income distribution; considering their relevance to analysis.
Data Type Transformation: No specific data type changes needed.

4. Prior Feedback and Updates
Feedback Received: Peer feedback suggested exploring government policies' impact on poverty.
Changes Made: Incorporated government spending data to analyze its correlation with poverty rates.
